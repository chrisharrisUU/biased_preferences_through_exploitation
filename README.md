### Structure of the repository

The data files are organized as follows: The main scripts can be found in the folder `Analyses`. These scripts load the raw data (from the `Data` folder), as well as helper functions that have been outsourced to the `Auxiliary` folder. The analyses are in the order also found in the manuscript, output is saved to the `Output` folder. Finally, the `Survey` folder includes stimulus material as well as the xml-files that make up the experiment as it was run on SosciSurvey.  

The `Analyses` folder furthermore contains script which allowed us to copy/paste Bayesian t-tests for robustness analyses. The `Auxiliary` folder contains two scripts for each experiment. One to import the raw data as it was downloaded from SosciSurvey into an R environment and one script that trims the dataset to completed cases, renames the variables of interest from SosciSurvey, and provides a function that recodes the counterbalancing measures we had taken during the survey. To allow easier access, we also provide a dataset in the `Data` folder in which all of these steps have already been undertaken and analyses can be run immediately. We named these datasets "Exp*X*_ready.csv". In R they can be immediately imported with the following code:  
`read.csv("Data/Exp\*X\*_ready.csv")`  
We also provide a second readme file in the `Data` folder that provides a codebook for the variables we use in these datasets.
